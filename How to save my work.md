# GitHub Beginner's Guide: How to Fork a Project and Upload Files

## Introduction

This guide will help students with no programming background or GitHub experience complete two basic operations:
1. Fork the specified Balls project
2. Upload new files to that project

## Preparation

Before starting, you need:
- A GitHub account (if you don't have one, please register at [GitHub.com](https://github.com))
- A web browser

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Fork the Balls Project

1. Log into your GitHub account using your browser
2. Open this link in your browser: [https://github.com/quenton1225/Balls](https://github.com/quenton1225/Balls)
3. Find and click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the project page
4. On the "Create a new fork" page that appears, **no need to modify any settings**, simply click the green "Create fork" button
5. Wait a moment while GitHub creates a copy of the project in your personal account
6. When complete, you'll automatically enter your forked project page (the URL will change to `https://github.com/your-username/Balls`)

### Step 2: Upload New Files

1. On your forked project page, find and click the "Add file" button above the file list
2. Select "Upload files" from the dropdown menu
3. On the page that opens, you can:
   - Drag and drop files from your computer to the designated area
   - Or click "choose your files" to select files from your computer
4. After selecting files, scroll down to the "Commit changes" section
5. In the text box under "Add files via upload", you can add a brief description of this upload
6. Click the green "Commit changes" button
7. Wait for the upload to complete, and the files will appear in your project

## Important Notes

- The entire forking process is very simple: just click the "Fork" button, then click "Create fork" without modifying any default settings
- A fork creates a copy of the original project; your changes won't affect the original project
- Make sure the files you upload meet the project or assignment requirements

## (Might Be) Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I confirm I've successfully forked the project?**
A: After successful forking, the browser address bar will show `https://github.com/your-username/Balls` instead of the original `https://github.com/quenton1225/Balls`.

**Q: What if I upload the wrong file?**
A: You can delete the file and upload again, or edit the content if it's a text file.

**Q: Do I need to tell the original project creator what changes I made?**
A: Unless specifically required, changes made to your fork typically remain in your copy only. If you need to contribute back to the original project, you would create a Pull Request.
